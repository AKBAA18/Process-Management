# Process-Management
The Process Management System organizes processes using a linked list, where each process is a node with ID, duration, priority, and state info. It sorts processes by priority for smooth execution. Users input a time slice, and the system updates process statuses accordingly. It's user-friendly and efficient, handling process management seamlessly.
